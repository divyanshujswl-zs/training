1. Implement a function that reverses a given slice without the use of another slice.  
2. Write a function in Golang that takes a word as input and returns a map of each character in the word with its count of occurrences.  
3. Write a function sumValuesByKey that takes a map m with string keys and slice of integer values, and returns a new map with the same keys and the sum of the integer values as the values.  
4. Write a function that accepts a slice and converts into a map.  
5. Implement a new type for Set. Operations that you can support on set are:  
   1. Create an empty set.  
   2. Add an element to the set  
   3. Delete an element from the set.  
   4. Test membership of an element in the set.  
6. Implement a new type called ordered map which will allow following operations:  
   1. Create a new empty ordered map.  
   2. Add an element to the ordered map.  
   3. Delete an element from the ordered map.  
   4. Way to iterate on the ordered map so that (key, values) returned during iteration is the same as the insertion order.  
7. Demonstrate append() behaviour with an example: Please note that append() need not always make a copy of the underlying buffer. If it has enough capacity, it will place the new data in the buffer and will not reallocate a new buffer. If the underlying buffer does not have enough capacity, it will create a new underlying buffer and copy the data. Write a code snippet that demonstrates this behaviour.
